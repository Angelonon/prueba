# Completion

Congratulations! üëç You have reached the end of the workshop.

In this workshop we 

- learned how to build scroll views efficiently, using lazy loading for our scrollable
- converted our scroll view to work directly with slivers
- explored the `SliverAppBar` and how it is complimented
by the `FlexibleSpaceBar` widget.

There are a lot more slivers to explore, like `SliverGrid` and
`SliverPadding`. Many are the sliver versions of common box widgets,
with the `Sliver` prefix.

To learn more about these widgets, and all the Flutter widgets,
you can 
- visit **_[flutter.dev](https://flutter.dev/)_** 
- dive in to our **_[API documentation](https://api.flutter.dev/)_**
- and check out the **_[Flutter Youtube channel](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCwXdFgeE9KYzlDdR7TG9cMw)_** for more tutorials & tips on creating your next great user experience.
