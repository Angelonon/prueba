# Introduction

Welcome to the introductory sliver codelab for Flutter!
In this workshop, you will learn how to efficiently build
scrolling widgets and use slivers directly to create a rich
scrolling experience for users.

What is a sliver? A sliver is a portion of scrollable area,
which means anything that scrolls in Flutter is a sliver.

This codelab is best for folks already familiar with building simple
Flutter applications. If this is your first time using Flutter,
